# Tags [WIP]

Welcome to the incomplete TagScript documentation. This will explain the custom TagScript blocks. If a block you are looking for isn't here, then you should check if its in the base [TagScriptEngine docs](https://github.com/JonSnowbd/TagScript).

### Blocks:
- command
- delete
- silent
- args
- author
- target
- channel
- server
- embed

**Block Syntax:**

`{block(parameter):payload}`

`[arg]` = Optional

`<arg>` = Required


**Command Block**

Usage: `{command: <command>}`

Aliases: `c, com, command`

Payload: command

Parameter: None

The command block will run the given command as if the tag invoker had ran it. Only 3 can be used in a tag.


**Delete Block**

Usage: `{delete([bool])`

Payload: None

Parameter: bool, None

Delete blocks will delete the invocation message if the given parameter is true. If there is no parameter i.e. `{delete}` it will default to true.

**Args Block**

Usage: `{args([index]:[splitter])`

Payload: splitter, None

Parameter: index, None

An args block represents the arguments that follow a command's invocation name. If an index is provided, it will return the word at that position in the arguments list. If not it will return all arguments. If a splitter is provided, indexing will split using that character instead of the default " ".


**Author Block**

Aliases: `user`

Usage: `{author([attribute])`

Payload: None

Parameter: attribute, None

By default this will return the tag invoker's full username. Certain attributes can be passed to the payload to access more information about the author. These include:

```
id
name
nick
avatar
discriminator
created_at
joined_at
mention
bot
```


**Target Block**

Aliases: `member`

Usage: `{target([attribute])`

Payload: None

Parameter: attribute, None

The target block has the same usage and functionaliy as the author block, but it references the first person mentioned in the invoke message, if someone was mentioned.


**Channel Block**

Usage: `{channel([attribute])`

Payload: None

Parameter: attribute, None

By default this will return the tag's invoke channel name. Certain attributes can be passed to the payload to access more information about the channel. These include:

```
id
name
discriminator
created_at
nsfw
mention
topic
```


**Server Block**

Aliases: `guild`

Usage: `{server([attribute])`

Payload: None

Parameter: attribute, None

By default this will return the tag's invoke server name. Certain attributes can be passed to the payload to access more information about the server. These include:

```
id
name
nick
icon
discriminator
member_count
description
```

**Embed Block**

Usage: `{embed(<json>)}`

Payload: json

Parameter: None

Embed blocks will send an embed in the tag response.
